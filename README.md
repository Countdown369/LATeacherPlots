# LATeacherPlots
Updated plots for my 2020 project, "Do LA's Best Teachers Go Where They're Needed Most?"

Made for The Dornsife Toolkit (Visualizing Data) in Fall 2020, lead by Andrzej Rutkowski and Stacy Williams of the University of Southern California. See https://visualizela.github.io/imagesLA/ for more information.
